# Project Plan

- Each time a user runs the program, they should receive a new random output
- Inspirational messages will be the output
- Consider outputs being made from 3 different pieces of data in an extended version

# Objectives

1. Build a message generator using JS
2. Use Git 
3. Use command line
4. Develop project locally

# Notes
- Create a simple version first
- Create an extended version, perhaps using objects
- Similar to the random dish program
- 3 different outputs e.g. random quote, random author, random date
